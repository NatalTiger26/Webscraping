       "    'The Structure and Power programme has introduced compelling compositional semantics for many approximations to homomorphism and isomorphism on finite structures which occur naturally in logic and computer science. This is largely done by the construction of game comonads such as those of Abramsky, Dawar and Wang [2], Abramsky and Shah [4], Abramsky and Marsden [3], and Montacute and Shah [7]. These all create formal links between structural decompositions which appear as coalgebras of the comonad and expressive power in some logical fragment which controls how the Kleilsi morphisms and isomorphisms approximate homomorphism and isomorphism of relational structures.While these comonads cover a wide range of decompositions and logical fragments, from an algorithmic perspective, the homomorphism and isomorphism approximations related to the known comonads are relatively weak. Indeed, of those mentioned, the strongest is the pebbling comonad whose Kleilsi morphisms and isomorphisms correspond respectively to the success of the k-local consistency and Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms. These are both long known to be unable to capture all efficiently computable instances of CSP and structure isomorphism [5]. Attempts to make game comonads which go beyond this have presented other difficulties. The Hella comonad of O Conghaile and Dawar, for example, captures a fragment of logic extended by quantifiers which are not, in general, computable. A game comonad for Dawar and Holm’s Invertible Maps equivalance [6] has long been sought but not found.',\n",

       "    'Game comonads have brought forth a new approach to studying finite model theory categorically. By representing model comparison games semantically as comonads, they allow important logical and combinatorial properties to be exressed in terms of their Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras. As a result, a number of results from finite model theory, such as preservation theorems and homomorphism counting theorems, have been formalised and parameterised by comonads, giving rise to new results simply by varying the comonad. In this paper we study the limits of the comonadic approach in the combinatorial and homomorphism-counting aspect of the theory, regardless of whether any model comparison games are involved. We show that any standard graph parameter has a corresponding comonad, classifying the same class. This comonad is constructed via a simple Kan extension formula, making it the initial solution to this problem and, furthermore, automatically admitting a homomorphism-counting theorem.',\n",

However, despite its centerstage role in modern physics, no experiment has tested it in an ostensibly quantum regime where both matter and light exhibit non-classical features. This paper shows that the interaction which gives rise to the light-bending also induces photon-matter entanglement as long as gravity and matter are treated at par with quantum mechanics. The quantum light-bending interaction within the framework of perturbative quantum gravity highlights this point by showing that the entangled states can be generated already with coherent states of light and matter exploiting the non-linear coupling induced by graviton exchange. Furthermore, the quantum light-bending interaction is capable of discerning between the spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons thus also providing a test for Nordstr\\\\\"{o}m gravity. We will conclude by estimating the order of magnitude of the entanglement generated by employing the linear entropy. In particular, we find that a ring cavity of radius  m placed around a  kg nanohertz mechanical oscillator could be used to generate linear entropy of order unity using a petawatt laser source.',\n",

The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars.

This is a semicoherent search which uses details of the signal model to coherently combine data separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search covered a range of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in orbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints. No significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz, correspond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less than 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is now probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For the usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron star, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted amplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin is aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the conservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz. Assuming a broader range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-wave amplitude delve into the relevant parameter space over a wide range of frequencies, to 500Hz or more.\",\n",

To obtain a large field of view, we developed a streak tube with a photocathode length as large as 35.3 mm, which is larger than the commonly used ST-HDR (30 mm). At the same time, the temporal resolution and dynamic spatial resolution are 60 ps and 12 lp/mm, which are very suitable to obtain accurate target coordinates for 4-D imaging. In addition, the streak tube has a high detection sensitivity of 46 mA/W at 500 nm and, hence, prospects in remote imaging. To test the performance of the streak tube, an underwater STIL experiment was conducted. Echo signal processing was performed by means of a bandpass filter and a matched filter, and then the peak detection algorithm was used to reconstruct the image. The results indicate that a spatial resolution better than 9 mm is achieved in the limpid water with a depth of 20 m, and a range accuracy of 1 cm is achieved in the turbid water with a depth of 10 m.

In Hamiltonian simulation, a physical Hamiltonian is engineered to have identical physics to another - often very different - Hamiltonian. This is qualitatively similar to the notion of duality in physics, whereby two superficially different theories are mathematically equivalent in some precise sense. However, existing characterisations of Hamiltonian simulations are not sufficiently general to extend to all dualities in physics. In particular, they cannot encompass the important cases of strong/weak and high-temperature/low-temperature dualities. In this work, we give three physically motivated axiomatisations of duality, formulated respectively in terms of observables, partition functions and entropies. We prove that these axiomatisations are equivalent, and characterise the mathematical form that any duality satisfying these axioms must take. A building block in one of our results is a strengthening of earlier results on entropy-preserving maps to maps that are entropy-preserving up to an additive constant, which we prove decompose as a direct sum of unitary and anti-unitary components, which may be of independent mathematical interest.',\n",

Many quantum simulation algorithms rely on a layer of unitary evolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears in time-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers under the Hamiltonian variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a new quantum algorithm design for materials modelling where the depth of a layer is independent of the system size. This design takes advantage of the locality of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding that preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and present a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of the specific target material. We present numerical results for materials spanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian.

Only 21% of site criteria acknowledge the importance of movement networks for birds, and such network criteria were mostly (67%) qualitative. We suggest a three-step quantitative approach for informing conservation about the connectivity of bird movements (especially when migrating) from a network perspective, by reviewing current scientific knowledge. The first step is to construct a bird movement network by identifying sites frequently used by birds as ‘nodes’, and then define ‘edges’ from the probability of non-stop flight between each pair of nodes. The second step is to quantify network connectivity, ie, the extent to which the site network facilitates bird movements.

While these telescopes can observe the sky in higher sensitivity and resolution than before, computational challenges in image reconstruction need to be overcome to realize the potential of forthcoming telescopes. New methods in sparse image reconstruction and convex optimization techniques (cf. compressive sensing) have shown to produce higher fidelity reconstructions of simulations and real observations than traditional methods. This article presents distributed and parallel algorithms and implementations to perform sparse image reconstruction, with significant practical considerations that are important for implementing these algorithms for Big Data. We benchmark the algorithms presented, showing that they are considerably faster than their serial equivalents. We then pre-sample gridding kernels to scale the distributed algorithms to larger data sizes, showing application times for 1 Gb to 2.4 Tb data sets over 25 to 100 nodes for up to 50 billion visibilities, and find that the run-times for the distributed algorithms range from 100 milliseconds to 3 minutes per iteration.

We call such bounds static bounds. The interesting feature of these bounds is that they hold for an arbitrary sequence of examples. Recently some work has been done where the predictor ut at each trial t is allowed to change with time, and the total on-line loss of the algorithm is compared to the sum of the losses of ut at each trial plus the total\\\\cost\" for shifting to successive predictors. This is to model situations in which the examples change over time, and different predictors from the comparison class are best for different segments of the sequence of examples. We call such bounds shifting bounds. They hold for arbitrary sequences of examples and arbitrary sequences of predictors. Naturally shifting bounds are much harder to prove. The only known bounds are for the case when the comparison class consists of a sequences of experts or boolean disjunctions. In this paper we develop the methodology for lifting known static bounds to the shifting case. In particular we obtain bounds when the comparison class consists of linear neurons (linear combinations of experts). Our essential technique is to project the hypothesis of the static algorithm at the end of each trial into a suitably chosen convex region. This keeps the hypothesis of the algorithm well-behaved and the static bounds can be converted to shifting bounds.',\n",

However, this progress might be at risk of slowing down if we do not address the discrepancy between our current computing power demands and what the existing technologies can offer. Key limitations to improving energy efficiency are the excessive growth of data transfer costs associated with the von Neumann architecture and the fundamental limits of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, such as transistors. In this perspective article, we discuss three technologies that will likely play an essential role in future computing systems: memristive electronics, spintronics, and electronics based on 2D materials.

Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory.

We further prove that a trade-off between the rate of this decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical quantum dynamics; long coherence times require strong diffusion in phase-space relative to the strength of the coupling. Applying the trade-off relation to gravity, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric and its conjugate momenta. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.

Here, we demonstrate that NLCE provide a powerful tool to explore MBL by simulating quench dynamics in disordered spin- two-leg ladders and Fermi-Hubbard chains. Combining NLCE with an efficient real-time evolution of pure states, we obtain converged results for the decay of the imbalance on long time scales and show that, especially for intermediate disorder below the putative MBL transition, NLCE outperform direct simulations of finite systems with open or periodic boundaries.

       "    'We derive the -matrix formalism tailored for the numerical analysis of second-harmonic (SH) generation from arbitrarily-shaped particles made of centrosymmetric optical materials. First, the transfer matrix of a single particle is computed \\\\textit{via} the extended boundary condition method, in which the electromagnetic fields both at fundamental frequency and SH are expanded in vector spherical wave functions and the integral formulation is satisfied away from the surface of the scatterer. We allow for the accurate physical description of the SH sources by taking into account both local surface and nonlocal bulk polarization contributions to the nonlinear polarization density source responsible for the generation of the SH signal in a particle. This single-particle formalism is then extended to arbitrary distributions of particles by incorporating into the formalism linear and nonlinear electromagnetic wave scattering from the particles in the cluster. Importantly from a practical point of view, our method can be applied to particles of arbitrary shape made of optical materials characterized by general frequency-dispersion relations, so that it can describe the linear and nonlinear optical response of clusters of metallic, semiconductor, or polaritonic particles, as well as mixtures of such particles. The approach proposed here is faster and more memory-efficient than well-established numerical techniques, especially in the analysis of spheroidal particles, due to the favourable symmetries of spherical wave basis functions used in the wave scattering analysis.',\n",

       "    'We present a Bayesian hierarchical framework to analyze photometric galaxy survey data with stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. Our method couples robust modeling of spectral energy distributions with a population model and a noise model to characterize the statistical properties of the galaxy populations and real observations, respectively. By self-consistently inferring all model parameters, from high-level hyper-parameters to SPS parameters of individual galaxies, one can separate sources of bias and uncertainty in the data. We demonstrate the strengths and flexibility of this approach by deriving accurate photometric redshifts for a sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the COSMOS field, achieving a performance competitive with publicly-released photometric redshift catalogs based on the same data. Prior to this work, this approach was computationally intractable in practice due to the heavy computational load of SPS model calls; we overcome this challenge using with neural emulators. We find that the largest photometric residuals are associated with poor calibration for emission line luminosities and thus build a framework to mitigate these effects. This combination of physics-based modeling accelerated with machine learning paves the path towards meeting the stringent requirements on the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation imposed by upcoming cosmological surveys. The approach also has the potential to create new links between cosmology and galaxy evolution through the analysis of photometric datasets.',\n",

Our forward model is composed of: a detailed population model describing the intrinsic distribution of physical characteristics of galaxies, encoding galaxy evolution physics; a stellar population synthesis model connecting the physical properties of galaxies to their photometry; a data-model characterizing the observation and calibration processes for a given survey; and, explicit treatment of selection cuts, both into the main analysis sample and subsequent sorting into tomographic redshift bins. This approach has the appeal that it does not rely on spectroscopic calibration data, provides explicit control over modeling assumptions, and builds a direct bridge between photo- inference and galaxy evolution physics. In addition to redshift distributions, forward modeling provides a framework for drawing robust inferences about the statistical properties of the galaxy population more generally. We demonstrate the utility of forward modeling by estimating the redshift distributions for the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and Vimos VLT Deep (VVDS) surveys, validating against their spectroscopic redshifts. Our baseline model is able to predict tomographic redshift distributions for GAMA and VVDS with a bias of  and  on the mean redshift respectively -- comfortably accurate enough for Stage III cosmological surveys -- without any hyper-parameter tuning (i.e., prior to doing any fitting to those data).

The identification of the optimal operating parameters, which ensures high sensitivity, is typically performed empirically and is often a lengthy process, which is especially labour intensive if frequent retuning of the magnetometer is required to perform different tasks. This paper demonstrates an efficient approach to RF-AM performance optimisation which relies on an open-loop optimisation technique based on Uniform Design (UD). This paper specifically describes the optimisation of an unshielded RF-AM based on a 4-factor-12-level UD of the experimental parameters space. The proposed procedure is shown to lead to the efficient optimisation of the atomic magnetometer at different frequencies, and is applicable to both AC and DC sensitivity optimisation. The procedure does not require any detailed knowledge of the model underlying the operation of the RF-AM and is effective in reducing the number of experimental runs required for the optimisation. It is ideally suited to self-calibration of devices without human supervision.',\n",

In the factorisation approximation (FA) the vacuum polarisation describes the interference fully non-perturbatively. The observed interference pattern by the LHCb collaboration is opposite in sign and and significantly enhanced as compared to the FA. A change of the FA-result by a factor of -2.5, which correspond to a 350%-corrections, results in a reasonable agreement with the data. This raises the question on the size of non-factorisable corrections which are colour enhanced but loop-suppressed. In the parton picture it is found that the corrections are of relative size ~-0.5 when averaged over the open charm-region which is far below -3.5 needed to explain the observed effect. We present combined fits to the BESII- and the LHCb-data, testing for effects beyond the Standard Model (SM)-FA.

Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent works have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs. However, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs:(1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space.(2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware.

Although planting resistant wheat cultivars is the most environmentally friendly and economically sound strategy, there is prevailing fear of breakdown of resistance due to development of virulent biotypes. Alternate molecular strategies that can complement native durable resistance are imperative, requiring a thorough understanding of the plant–insect interaction at the molecular level. To expand our understanding of this interaction, we analyzed the transcriptomes of Hessian fly larvae feeding on host susceptible (V3) and resistant (A3) wheat as well as larvae feeding on Brachypodium distachyon plants (Bd3) at 3 days after egg-hatch (Fig. 1). Brachypodium exhibits nonhost resistance resembling the resistant host wheat phenotypically but displaying molecular responses that are intermediate between resistant and susceptible host wheat.Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed similar molecular responses between V3 and Bd3 larvae that were very distinct from those observed in in A3 larvae (Fig. 2). Differentially expressed genes involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) pathway, proteases, lipases, and detoxification (Fig. 3) were significantly up-regulated in both V3 and Bd3 larvae and are beneficial for the growth and development of the larvae.

Phyllachora maydis cannot be cultured in media; therefore, the inoculum source for studying tar spot comprises leaves with stromata collected from naturally infected plants. Currently, there is no effective protocol to induce infection under controlled conditions. In this study, an inoculation method was assessed under greenhouse and growth chamber conditions to test whether stromata of P. maydis could be induced on corn leaves.Results: Experiments resulted in incubation periods ranging between 18 to 20 days and stromata development at the beginning of corn growth stage VT-R1 (silk). The induced stromata of P. maydis were con rmed by microscopy, PCR, or both. From thirteen experiments conducted, four (31%) resulted in the successful production of stromata.

       "    'The Hessian fly is a destructive pest of wheat. Employing additional molecular strategies can complement wheat’s native insect resistance. However, this requires functional characterization of Hessian-fly-responsive genes, which is challenging because of wheat genome complexity. The diploid Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) exhibits nonhost resistance to Hessian fly and displays phenotypic/molecular responses intermediate between resistant and susceptible host wheat, offering a surrogate genome for gene characterization. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of Biotype L larvae residing on resistant/susceptible wheat, and nonhost Bd plants. Larvae from susceptible wheat and nonhost Bd plants revealed similar molecular responses that were distinct from avirulent larval responses on resistant wheat. Secreted salivary gland proteins were strongly up-regulated in all larvae. Genes from various biological pathways and molecular processes were up-regulated in larvae from both susceptible wheat and nonhost Bd plants. However, Bd larval expression levels were intermediate between larvae from susceptible and resistant wheat. Most genes were down-regulated or unchanged in avirulent larvae, correlating with their inability to establish feeding sites and dying within 4–5 days after egg-hatch. Decreased gene expression in Bd larvae, compared to ones on susceptible wheat, potentially led to developmentally delayed 2nd-instars, followed by eventually succumbing to nonhost resistance defense mechanisms.

In this case, the materials are requested to have both the desired refractive index and correct chemical property.In this work, we investigated the SiNx as an ARC and surface passivation layer, as it is excellent dielectric material for low-loss Si photonics, with its refractive indices continuously adjustable from 1.7-3.0 in telecom range by changing N/Si ratio.[4] From our FDTD simulations, a SiNx with n= 2.5 (Si-rich SiNx) and thickness of 130 nm is required as an ARC between 1.3 μm QD optical active layer and a stoichiometric SiN waveguide on Si to minimize the retroreflections. In order to perform a systematic study of the surface/interface passivation, we fabricated three ELEDs, with Si-rich SiNx coating (A), with\\xa0…',\n",

In this experiment, we measure the distribution function of polaritons inside an annular optical trap in a GaAs microcavity under non-resonant pumping for different detunings and bath temperatures. The annular optical trap forms a repulsive potential originating from the interactions of polaritons with the excitonic reservoir, hence trapping the polaritons inside. We explore the conditions needed for equilibration of the polaritons and the sensitivity to the density of states of the trap. We also report the observation of critical fluctuations of the polariton photoluminescence near the critical density of condensation.',\n",

The presence of a symmetry implies that a physical system is invariant under specific transformations, and this invariance may have deep consequences. For instance, symmetry arguments state that a system will remain in its initial state if incentives to actions are equally balanced. Here, we apply this principle to a chain of qubits and show that it is possible to engineer the symmetries of its Hamiltonian in order to keep quantum information intrinsically protected from both relaxation and decoherence. We show that the coherence properties of this system are strongly enhanced relative to those of its individual components. Such a qubit chain can be realized using a simple architecture consisting of a relatively small number of superconducting Josephson junctions.',\n",

       "    'Photonic materials are a rapidly growing platform for studying condensed matter physics with light, where the exquisite control capability is allowing us to learn about the relation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic properties. One of the most interesting aspects of condensed matter is the interplay between interactions and the effect of an external magnetic field or rotation, responsible for a plethora of rich phenomena---Hall physics and quantized vortex arrays. At first sight, however, these effects for photons seem vetoed: they do not interact with each other and they are immune to magnetic fields and rotations. Yet in specially devised structures these effects can be engineered. Here, we propose the use of a synthetic magnetic field induced by strain in a honeycomb lattice of resonators to create a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate of light-matter particles (polaritons) in a rotating state, without the actual need for external rotation nor reciprocity-breaking elements. We show that thanks to the competition between interactions, dissipation and a suitably designed incoherent pump, the condensate spontaneously becomes chiral by selecting a single Dirac valley of the honeycomb lattice, occupying the lowest Landau level and forming a vortex array. Our results offer a new platform where to study the exciting physics of arrays of quantized vortices with light and pave the way to explore the transition from a vortex-dominated phase to the photonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall regime.',\n",

       "    'The Structure and Power programme has introduced compelling compositional semantics for many approximations to homomorphism and isomorphism on finite structures which occur naturally in logic and computer science. This is largely done by the construction of game comonads such as those of Abramsky, Dawar and Wang [2], Abramsky and Shah [4], Abramsky and Marsden [3], and Montacute and Shah [7]. These all create formal links between structural decompositions which appear as coalgebras of the comonad and expressive power in some logical fragment which controls how the Kleilsi morphisms and isomorphisms approximate homomorphism and isomorphism of relational structures.While these comonads cover a wide range of decompositions and logical fragments, from an algorithmic perspective, the homomorphism and isomorphism approximations related to the known comonads are relatively weak. Indeed, of those mentioned, the strongest is the pebbling comonad whose Kleilsi morphisms and isomorphisms correspond respectively to the success of the k-local consistency and Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms. These are both long known to be unable to capture all efficiently computable instances of CSP and structure isomorphism [5]. Attempts to make game comonads which go beyond this have presented other difficulties. The Hella comonad of O Conghaile and Dawar, for example, captures a fragment of logic extended by quantifiers which are not, in general, computable. A game comonad for Dawar and Holm’s Invertible Maps equivalance [6] has long been sought but not found.',\n",

By representing model comparison games semantically as comonads, they allow important logical and combinatorial properties to be exressed in terms of their Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras. As a result, a number of results from finite model theory, such as preservation theorems and homomorphism counting theorems, have been formalised and parameterised by comonads, giving rise to new results simply by varying the comonad. In this paper we study the limits of the comonadic approach in the combinatorial and homomorphism-counting aspect of the theory, regardless of whether any model comparison games are involved. We show that any standard graph parameter has a corresponding comonad, classifying the same class. This comonad is constructed via a simple Kan extension formula, making it the initial solution to this problem and, furthermore, automatically admitting a homomorphism-counting theorem.',\n",

However, despite its centerstage role in modern physics, no experiment has tested it in an ostensibly quantum regime where both matter and light exhibit non-classical features. This paper shows that the interaction which gives rise to the light-bending also induces photon-matter entanglement as long as gravity and matter are treated at par with quantum mechanics. The quantum light-bending interaction within the framework of perturbative quantum gravity highlights this point by showing that the entangled states can be generated already with coherent states of light and matter exploiting the non-linear coupling induced by graviton exchange. Furthermore, the quantum light-bending interaction is capable of discerning between the spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons thus also providing a test for Nordstr\\\\\"{o}m gravity. We will conclude by estimating the order of magnitude of the entanglement generated by employing the linear entropy.

Here, we present a quantum machine learning (QML) framework, inspired by VQAs, to tackle the problem of finding time-independent Hamiltonians that generate desired unitary evolutions, i.e. multi-qubit quantum gates. The Hamiltonians are designed by tuning local fields and two-body interaction terms only. We find that our approach achieves high fidelity quantum gates, such as the Toffoli gate, with a significantly lower computational complexity than is possible classically. This method can also be extended to realize higher-order multi-controlled quantum gates, which could be directly applied to quantum error correction (QEC) schemes.',\n",

We introduce, investigate, and compare several information-theoretic quantifications of memory and discover a hierarchical relationship among them. We also find that while the Holevo quantity is the most complete quantifier of memory, vastly outperforming the imbalance, its decohered counterpart is significantly better at capturing the critical properties of the many-body localization transition at small system sizes. This motivates our suggestion that one can emulate the thermodynamic limit by artificially decohering otherwise quantum quantities. Applying this method to the von Neumann entropy results in critical exponents consistent with analytic predictions, a feature missing from similar small finite-size system treatments. In addition, the decohering process makes experiments\\xa0…',\n",

This generalization is completely divested from the notion of separability and can be freely tuned as a function of the bond dimension to target states which vary in entanglement complexity. We first demonstrate its value in a toy spin-1 model where, unlike the conventional geometric entanglement, it successfully identifies the AKLT ground state. We then investigate the phase diagram of a Haldane chain with uniaxial and rhombic anisotropies, revealing that the generalized geometric entanglement can successfully detect all its phases and their entanglement complexity. Finally we investigate the disordered spin- Heisenberg model, where we find that differences in generalized geometric entanglements can be used as lucrative signatures of the ergodic-localized entanglement transition.',\n",

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars\\xa0…',\n",

       "    \"We present the results of a model-based search for continuous gravitational waves from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 using LIGO detector data from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA. This is a semicoherent search which uses details of the signal model to coherently combine data separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search covered a range of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in orbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints. No significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz, correspond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less than 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is now probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For the usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron star, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted amplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin is aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the conservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz. Assuming a broader range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-wave amplitude delve into the relevant parameter space over a wide range of frequencies, to 500Hz or more.\",\n",

       "    'Streak tube imaging lidar (STIL) can obtain 4-D images of a target, and its performance is mainly determined by the streak tube sensor. To obtain a large field of view, we developed a streak tube with a photocathode length as large as 35.3 mm, which is larger than the commonly used ST-HDR (30 mm). At the same time, the temporal resolution and dynamic spatial resolution are 60 ps and 12 lp/mm, which are very suitable to obtain accurate target coordinates for 4-D imaging. In addition, the streak tube has a high detection sensitivity of 46 mA/W at 500 nm and, hence, prospects in remote imaging. To test the performance of the streak tube, an underwater STIL experiment was conducted. Echo signal processing was performed by means of a bandpass filter and a matched filter, and then the peak detection algorithm was used to reconstruct the image. The results indicate that a spatial resolution better than 9 mm is achieved in the limpid water with a depth of 20 m, and a range accuracy of 1 cm is achieved in the turbid water with a depth of 10 m. Such a performance suggests that the large-field streak tube is of great potential for underwater target imaging and other remote imaging applications.',\n",

       "    'Analogue Hamiltonian simulation is a promising near-term application of quantum computing and has recently been put on a theoretical footing. In Hamiltonian simulation, a physical Hamiltonian is engineered to have identical physics to another - often very different - Hamiltonian. This is qualitatively similar to the notion of duality in physics, whereby two superficially different theories are mathematically equivalent in some precise sense. However, existing characterisations of Hamiltonian simulations are not sufficiently general to extend to all dualities in physics. In particular, they cannot encompass the important cases of strong/weak and high-temperature/low-temperature dualities. In this work, we give three physically motivated axiomatisations of duality, formulated respectively in terms of observables, partition functions and entropies. We prove that these axiomatisations are equivalent, and characterise the mathematical form that any duality satisfying these axioms must take. A building block in one of our results is a strengthening of earlier results on entropy-preserving maps to maps that are entropy-preserving up to an additive constant, which we prove decompose as a direct sum of unitary and anti-unitary components, which may be of independent mathematical interest.',\n",

Many quantum simulation algorithms rely on a layer of unitary evolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears in time-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers under the Hamiltonian variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a new quantum algorithm design for materials modelling where the depth of a layer is independent of the system size. This design takes advantage of the locality of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding that preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and present a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of the specific target material. We present numerical results for materials spanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian.

However, the ability to non-destructively obtain atomic-species-specific images of the final structure, which would be an indispensable tool for building more complex nano-scale devices, such as quantum co-processors, remains an unresolved challenge. Here we exploit X-ray fluorescence to create an element-specific image of As dopants in silicon, with dopant densities in absolute units and a resolution limited by the beam focal size (here m), without affecting the device's low temperature electronic properties. The As densities provided by the X-ray data are compared to those derived from Hall effect measurements as well as the standard non-repeatable, scanning tunnelling microscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy, techniques. Before and after the X-ray experiments, we also measured the magneto-conductance, dominated by weak localisation, a quantum interference effect extremely sensitive to sample dimensions and disorder.

Only 21% of site criteria acknowledge the importance of movement networks for birds, and such network criteria were mostly (67%) qualitative. We suggest a three-step quantitative approach for informing conservation about the connectivity of bird movements (especially when migrating) from a network perspective, by reviewing current scientific knowledge. The first step is to construct a bird movement network by identifying sites frequently used by birds as ‘nodes’, and then define ‘edges’ from the probability of non-stop flight between each pair of nodes. The second step is to quantify network connectivity, ie, the extent to which the site network facilitates bird movements.

Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto-and sub-femtosecond time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even tens of attoseconds (1 attosecond= 1 as= 10− 18 s), which is comparable with the optical field. For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom is∼ 152 as.

New methods in sparse image reconstruction and convex optimization techniques (cf. compressive sensing) have shown to produce higher fidelity reconstructions of simulations and real observations than traditional methods. This article presents distributed and parallel algorithms and implementations to perform sparse image reconstruction, with significant practical considerations that are important for implementing these algorithms for Big Data.

We call such bounds static bounds. The interesting feature of these bounds is that they hold for an arbitrary sequence of examples. Recently some work has been done where the predictor ut at each trial t is allowed to change with time, and the total on-line loss of the algorithm is compared to the sum of the losses of ut at each trial plus the total\\\\cost\" for shifting to successive predictors. This is to model situations in which the examples change over time, and different predictors from the comparison class are best for different segments of the sequence of examples. We call such bounds shifting bounds. They hold for arbitrary sequences of examples and arbitrary sequences of predictors. Naturally shifting bounds are much harder to prove. The only known bounds are for the case when the comparison class consists of a sequences of experts or boolean disjunctions. In this paper we develop the methodology for lifting known static bounds to the shifting case. In particular we obtain bounds when the comparison class consists of linear neurons (linear combinations of experts). Our essential technique is to project the hypothesis of the static algorithm at the end of each trial into a suitably chosen convex region. This keeps the hypothesis of the algorithm well-behaved and the static bounds can be converted to shifting bounds.',\n",

The performance of existing algorithms for the multi-scale expert problem degrades linearly proportional to the maximum reward range of any expert or the best expert and does not capture the non-uniform heterogeneity in the reward ranges among experts. In this work, we propose learning algorithms that construct a hierarchical tree structure based on the heterogeneity of the reward range of experts and then determine differentiated learning rates based on the reward upper bounds and cumulative empirical feedback over time. We then characterize the regret of the proposed algorithms as a function of non-uniform reward ranges and show that their regrets outperform prior algorithms when the rewards of experts exhibit non-uniform heterogeneity in different ranges.

A main motivation for this study are online recommendation systems, in which each of  users is associated with a MAB problem and the goal is to exploit users' similarity in order to learn users' preferences to  items more efficiently. We consider the adversarial MAB setting, whereby an adversary is free to choose which user and which loss to present to the learner during the learning process. Users are in a social network and the learner is aided by a-priori knowledge of the strengths of the social links between all pairs of users. It is assumed that if the social link between two users is strong then they tend to share the same action. The regret is measured relative to an arbitrary function which maps users to actions. The smoothness of the function is captured by a resistance-based dispersion measure . We present two learning algorithms, GABA-I and GABA-II, which exploit the network structure to bias towards functions of low  values. We show that GABA-I has an expected regret bound of  and per-trial time complexity of , whilst GABA-II has a weaker  regret, but a better  per-trial time complexity.

The majority of neuromorphic computing is currently software-based, where neural network properties and performance can be reconfigured to suit different computational tasks. This critical functionality is missing in ``physical\" reservoir computing schemes that exploit nonlinear and history-dependent memory responses of physical systems for data processing. Here, we experimentally present a `task-adaptive\\' approach to physical reservoir computing, capable of reconfiguring key reservoir properties (nonlinearity, memory-capacity and complexity) to optimise computational performance across a broad range of tasks. As a model case of this, we use the temperature and magnetic-field controlled spin-wave response of CuOSeO that hosts skyrmion, conical and helical magnetic phases, providing on-demand access to a host of different physical reservoir responses. We quantify phase-tunable reservoir performance, characterise their properties and discuss the correlation between these in physical reservoirs. This task-adaptive approach overcomes key prior limitations of physical reservoirs, opening opportunities to apply thermodynamically stable and metastable phase control across a wide variety of physical reservoir systems.',\n",

Despite recent studies covering the optical frequency range, achieving spin wave control at microwave frequencies is highly desirable, a regime where modern integrated information technologies predominantly operate. The intrinsically small numbers of spins, however, poses a major challenge to this. Here, we present a novel approach to detect spin dynamics mediated by photon-magnon coupling between high-Q superconducting resonators and ultra-thin flakes of CrGeTe (CGT) as thin as 11 nm. We test and benchmark our technique with 23 individual CGT flakes and extract an upper limit for the Gilbert damping parameter.

It is important from both pragmatic and theoretical points of view to know the relationships between the two components. To make this point more clear, we develop and investigate the quantum-information processing paradigm in which parties sharing a multipartite state distill local information. The amount of information which is lost because the parties must use a classical communication channel is the deficit. This scheme can be viewed as complementary to the notion of distilling entanglement. After reviewing the paradigm in detail, we show that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative entropy distance to so-called pseudoclassically correlated states; the lower bound is the relative entropy of entanglement\\xa0…',\n",

In fact, the link between uncertainty and nonlocality holds for all physical theories.

Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory.

This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.

The distinctive features             of these waveguides are that they have extremely large third-order susceptibility                χ^(3) and dispersive properties. The strong dispersion and large             third-order nonlinearity in Si photonic wires cause the linear and nonlinear optical             physics in these guides to be intimately linked. By carefully choosing the waveguide             dimensions, both linear and nonlinear optical properties of Si wires can be engineered.             We review the fundamental optical physics and emerging applications for these Si wires.

First, the transfer matrix of a single particle is computed \\\\textit{via} the extended boundary condition method, in which the electromagnetic fields both at fundamental frequency and SH are expanded in vector spherical wave functions and the integral formulation is satisfied away from the surface of the scatterer. We allow for the accurate physical description of the SH sources by taking into account both local surface and nonlocal bulk polarization contributions to the nonlinear polarization density source responsible for the generation of the SH signal in a particle. This single-particle formalism is then extended to arbitrary distributions of particles by incorporating into the formalism linear and nonlinear electromagnetic wave scattering from the particles in the cluster. Importantly from a practical point of view, our method can be applied to particles of arbitrary shape made of optical materials characterized by general frequency-dispersion relations, so that it can describe the linear and nonlinear optical response of clusters of metallic, semiconductor, or polaritonic particles, as well as mixtures of such particles. The approach proposed here is faster and more memory-efficient than well-established numerical techniques, especially in the analysis of spheroidal particles, due to the favourable symmetries of spherical wave basis functions used in the wave scattering analysis.',\n",

ALPHA will be sensitive to QCD axions over almost a decade of parameter space, potentially discovering dark matter and resolving the Strong CP problem. Unlike traditional cavity haloscopes, which are generally limited in volume by the Compton wavelength of the dark matter, plasma haloscopes use a wire metamaterial to create a tuneable artificial plasma frequency, decoupling the wavelength of light from the Compton wavelength and allowing for much stronger signals.

Our method couples robust modeling of spectral energy distributions with a population model and a noise model to characterize the statistical properties of the galaxy populations and real observations, respectively. By self-consistently inferring all model parameters, from high-level hyper-parameters to SPS parameters of individual galaxies, one can separate sources of bias and uncertainty in the data. We demonstrate the strengths and flexibility of this approach by deriving accurate photometric redshifts for a sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the COSMOS field, achieving a performance competitive with publicly-released photometric redshift catalogs based on the same data. Prior to this work, this approach was computationally intractable in practice due to the heavy computational load of SPS model calls; we overcome this challenge using with neural emulators. We find that the largest photometric residuals are associated with poor calibration for emission line luminosities and thus build a framework to mitigate these effects. This combination of physics-based modeling accelerated with machine learning paves the path towards meeting the stringent requirements on the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation imposed by upcoming cosmological surveys. The approach also has the potential to create new links between cosmology and galaxy evolution through the analysis of photometric datasets.',\n",

Our forward model is composed of: a detailed population model describing the intrinsic distribution of physical characteristics of galaxies, encoding galaxy evolution physics; a stellar population synthesis model connecting the physical properties of galaxies to their photometry; a data-model characterizing the observation and calibration processes for a given survey; and, explicit treatment of selection cuts, both into the main analysis sample and subsequent sorting into tomographic redshift bins. This approach has the appeal that it does not rely on spectroscopic calibration data, provides explicit control over modeling assumptions, and builds a direct bridge between photo- inference and galaxy evolution physics. In addition to redshift distributions, forward modeling provides a framework for drawing robust inferences about the statistical properties of the galaxy population more generally. We demonstrate the utility of forward modeling by estimating the redshift distributions for the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and Vimos VLT Deep (VVDS) surveys, validating against their spectroscopic redshifts. Our baseline model is able to predict tomographic redshift distributions for GAMA and VVDS with a bias of  and  on the mean redshift respectively -- comfortably accurate enough for Stage III cosmological surveys -- without any hyper-parameter tuning (i.e., prior to doing any fitting to those data).

The identification of the optimal operating parameters, which ensures high sensitivity, is typically performed empirically and is often a lengthy process, which is especially labour intensive if frequent retuning of the magnetometer is required to perform different tasks. This paper demonstrates an efficient approach to RF-AM performance optimisation which relies on an open-loop optimisation technique based on Uniform Design (UD). This paper specifically describes the optimisation of an unshielded RF-AM based on a 4-factor-12-level UD of the experimental parameters space. The proposed procedure is shown to lead to the efficient optimisation of the atomic magnetometer at different frequencies, and is applicable to both AC and DC sensitivity optimisation. The procedure does not require any detailed knowledge of the model underlying the operation of the RF-AM and is effective in reducing the number of experimental runs required for the optimisation.

The observed interference pattern by the LHCb collaboration is opposite in sign and and significantly enhanced as compared to the FA. A change of the FA-result by a factor of -2.5, which correspond to a 350%-corrections, results in a reasonable agreement with the data. This raises the question on the size of non-factorisable corrections which are colour enhanced but loop-suppressed.

       "    'Very little is known about the cost landscape for parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent works have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs. However, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs:(1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space.(2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware. Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate transformations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method.',\n",

Although planting resistant wheat cultivars is the most environmentally friendly and economically sound strategy, there is prevailing fear of breakdown of resistance due to development of virulent biotypes. Alternate molecular strategies that can complement native durable resistance are imperative, requiring a thorough understanding of the plant–insect interaction at the molecular level. To expand our understanding of this interaction, we analyzed the transcriptomes of Hessian fly larvae feeding on host susceptible (V3) and resistant (A3) wheat as well as larvae feeding on Brachypodium distachyon plants (Bd3) at 3 days after egg-hatch (Fig. 1). Brachypodium exhibits nonhost resistance resembling the resistant host wheat phenotypically but displaying molecular responses that are intermediate between resistant and susceptible host wheat.Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed similar molecular responses between V3 and Bd3 larvae that were very distinct from those observed in in A3 larvae (Fig. 2). Differentially expressed genes involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) pathway, proteases, lipases, and detoxification (Fig. 3) were significantly up-regulated in both V3 and Bd3 larvae and are beneficial for the growth and development of the larvae.

The diploid Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) exhibits nonhost resistance to Hessian fly and displays phenotypic/molecular responses intermediate between resistant and susceptible host wheat, offering a surrogate genome for gene characterization. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of Biotype L larvae residing on resistant/susceptible wheat, and nonhost Bd plants. Larvae from susceptible wheat and nonhost Bd plants revealed similar molecular responses that were distinct from avirulent larval responses on resistant wheat. Secreted salivary gland proteins were strongly up-regulated in all larvae. Genes from various biological pathways and molecular processes were up-regulated in larvae from both susceptible wheat and nonhost Bd plants. However, Bd larval expression levels were intermediate between larvae from susceptible and resistant wheat. Most genes were down-regulated or unchanged in avirulent larvae, correlating with their inability to establish feeding sites and dying within 4–5 days after egg-hatch.

Recent breakthrough in InAs quantum-dot (QD) grown on various substrates with emission wavelength in O-band range enables the development of high-brightness ELEDs,[2] including super-luminescent LEDs.[3] In order to efficiently couple the emitting light out of an ELED, an anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer is required.

Here, we apply this principle to a chain of qubits and show that it is possible to engineer the symmetries of its Hamiltonian in order to keep quantum information intrinsically protected from both relaxation and decoherence. We show that the coherence properties of this system are strongly enhanced relative to those of its individual components.

       "    'Photonic materials are a rapidly growing platform for studying condensed matter physics with light, where the exquisite control capability is allowing us to learn about the relation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic properties. One of the most interesting aspects of condensed matter is the interplay between interactions and the effect of an external magnetic field or rotation, responsible for a plethora of rich phenomena---Hall physics and quantized vortex arrays. At first sight, however, these effects for photons seem vetoed: they do not interact with each other and they are immune to magnetic fields and rotations. Yet in specially devised structures these effects can be engineered. Here, we propose the use of a synthetic magnetic field induced by strain in a honeycomb lattice of resonators to create a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate of light-matter particles (polaritons) in a rotating state, without the actual need for external rotation nor reciprocity-breaking elements. We show that thanks to the competition between interactions, dissipation and a suitably designed incoherent pump, the condensate spontaneously becomes chiral by selecting a single Dirac valley of the honeycomb lattice, occupying the lowest Landau level and forming a vortex array. Our results offer a new platform where to study the exciting physics of arrays of quantized vortices with light and pave the way to explore the transition from a vortex-dominated phase to the photonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall regime.',\n",

       "    'Abstract Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS) is a well known phenomenon occurring when charged particles traverse materials. Measurements of muons traversing low  materials made in the MuScat experiment showed that theoretical models and simulation codes, such as GEANT4 (v7. 0), over-estimated the scattering. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) measured the cooling of a muon beam traversing a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride (LiH) energy absorber as part of a programme to develop muon accelerator facilities, such as a Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider. The energy loss and MCS that occur in the absorber material are competing effects that alter the performance of the cooling channel. Therefore measurements of MCS are required in order to validate the simulations used to predict the cooling performance in future accelerator facilities. We report measurements made in the MICE apparatus of MCS using a LiH absorber and muons within the momentum range 160 to 245 MeV/c. The measured RMS scattering width is about 9% smaller than that predicted by the approximate formula proposed by the Particle Data Group. Data at 172, 200 and 240 MeV/c are compared to the GEANT4 (v9. 6) default scattering model. These measurements show agreement with this more recent GEANT4 (v9. 6) version over the range of incident muon momenta.',\n",

       "    'Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS) is a well known phenomenon occurring when charged particles traverse materials. Measurements of muons traversing low  materials made in the MuScat experiment showed that theoretical models and simulation codes, such as GEANT4 (v7.0), over-estimated the scattering. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) measured the cooling of a muon beam traversing a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride (LiH) energy absorber as part of a programme to develop muon accelerator facilities, such as a Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider. The energy loss and MCS that occur in the absorber material are competing effects that alter the performance of the cooling channel. Therefore measurements of MCS are required in order to validate the simulations used to predict the cooling performance in future accelerator facilities. We report measurements made in the MICE apparatus of MCS using a LiH absorber and muons within the momentum range 160 to 245 MeV/c. The measured RMS scattering width is about 9% smaller than that predicted by the approximate formula proposed by the Particle Data Group. Data at 172, 200 and 240 MeV/c are compared to the GEANT4 (v9.6) default scattering model. These measurements show agreement with this more recent GEANT4 (v9.6) version over the range of incident muon momenta.',\n",

       "    'The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a two dimensional square lattice has long been an important testbed and target for simulating fermionic Hamiltonians on quantum hardware. We present an alternative for quantum simulation of FHMs based on an adiabatic protocol that could be an attractive target for next generations of quantum annealers. Our results rely on a recently introduced low-weight encoding that allows the FHM to be expressed in terms of Pauli operators with locality of at most three. We theoretically and numerically determine promising quantum annealing setups for both interacting 2D spinless and spinful systems, that enable to reach near the ground state solution with high fidelity for systems as big as  (spinless) and  (spinful). Moreover, we demonstrate the scaling properties of the minimal gap and analyze robustness of the protocol against control noise. Additionally, we identify and discuss basic experimental requirements to construct near term annealing hardware tailored to simulate these problems. Finally, we perform a detailed resource estimation for the introduced adiabatic protocol, and discuss pros and cons of this approach relative to gate-based approaches for near-term platforms.',\n",

       "    'A finite length ferromagnetic chain with opposite spin polarization imposed at its two ends is one of the simplest frustrated spin models. In the clean classical limit the domain wall inserted on account of the boundary conditions resides with equal probability on any one of the bonds, and the degeneracy is precisely equal to the number of bonds. If quantum mechanics is introduced via a transverse field, the domain wall will behave as a particle in a box, and prefer to be nearer the middle of the chain rather than the ends. A simple characteristic of a real quantum annealer is therefore which of these limits obtains in practice. Here we have used the ferromagnetic chain with antiparallel boundary spins to test a real flux qubit quantum annealer and discover that contrary to both expectations, the domain walls found are non-uniformly distributed on account of effective random longitudinal fields present notwithstanding\\xa0…',\n",
